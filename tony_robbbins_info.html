<h3>Early life</h3>
Robbins was born as Anthony J. Mahavoric in North Hollywood, California, on February 29, 1960.[6] Robbins is the eldest of three children and his parents divorced when he was 7. His mother then remarried (more than once), including a marriage with Jim Robbins, a former semi-professional baseball player who legally adopted Anthony when he was 12.
Tony Robbins was raised in Glendora, California, and attended Glendora High School. He was elected student body president in his senior year. While growing up, Robbins worked as a handyman to help provide for his siblings.[8]

During high school, Robbins grew ten inches, a growth spurt later attributed to a pituitary tumor.[6] He has said his home life was "chaotic" and "abusive". When he was seventeen years old, he left home and never returned.[6] Robbins later worked as a janitor, and did not attend college.

<h3>Career</h3>
Robbins began his career promoting seminars for motivational speaker and author Jim Rohn when he was 17 years old.[9][10][11]

In the early 1980s, soon after meeting Neurolinguistic Programming co-founder John Grinder, the two became partners. At this time Robbins taught NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis.[11] In 1983 Robbins learned to firewalk, and incorporated it into his seminars.[12]

In 1988 Robbins released his first infomercial, Personal Power, produced by Guthy Renker, which helped to promote his services as a "peak performance coach". The infomercial helped Robbins gain wide exposure, selling his Personal Power self-help audiotapes. His early infomercials featured celebrities such as Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton and actor Martin Sheen. By 1991 an estimated 100 million Americans in 200 media markets had seen his infomercials.

In 1997, Robbins began the Leadership Academy seminar.[15][16] He is a speaker on the seminar circuit sponsored by Learning Annex. Robbins was a featured speaker at the 2007 Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) conference. Approximately 4 million people have attended his live seminars.

Together with Cloé Madanes, Robbins founded the Robbins-Madanes Center for Intervention, an organization that trains life skills coaches to help families and individuals deal with addiction and other issues.

In 2014, Robbins, along with a group of investors including Magic Johnson, Mia Hamm, and Peter Guber, acquired rights to launch a Major League Soccer franchise in Los Angeles, California, currently referred to as the Los Angeles Football Club. The soccer team began competition in 2018.[19][20][21]

In 2016, Robbins partnered with Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber and Washington Wizards co-owner Ted Leonsis to purchase Team Liquid, an eSports pro gaming organization.[22] In 2017 Team Liquid won The International 7, a Dota 2 tournament with a prize pool of over $24 million.[23]

Robbins has worked on an individual basis with Bill Clinton,[24] Justin Tuck,[25] Wayne Gretzky, Serena Williams, Hugh Jackman and Pitbull.[28] He has also counseled American businessmen Peter Guber, Steve Wynn and Marc Benioff.[29] He was named one of the "Top 50 Business Intellectuals" by Accenture and one of the "Top 200 Business Gurus" by the Harvard Business Press,[31] and in 2007 was ranked on the Forbes Celebrity 100.

Robbins was criticized for critical comments made about the Me Too movement at a seminar in San Jose, California on March 15, 2018. According to a video of the event released on social media by NowThisNews,[34] Robbins stated his opinion that, "If you use the #MeToo movement to try to get significance and certainty by attacking and destroying someone else… all you've done is basically use a drug called significance to make yourself feel good." He went on to tell a story about a "very powerful man" who passed on hiring a female candidate even though she was the most qualified because she was too attractive and would be "too big a risk". Following criticism for these comments, Robbins posted an apology on his Facebook page, saying 'I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.'
